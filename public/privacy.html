        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This application runs entirely within your browser.
             As such, no user data is ever sent to our server, and is not stored.</p>
        <p>As this application is designed to allow you to manage your YouTube playlists,
             we require an access token (OAuth 2.0) with authorisation to manage your YouTube account.
            This token may be stored in browser storage (localStorage) to reduce logins, on explicit user request.
             At no point is this token ever sent to our or any third-party server apart from the YouTube Data API as detailed below.</p>
        <p>This application uses the following third-party services:
            <ul>
                <li>Cloudflare (reverse proxy)
                    <p>
                        We use Cloudflare as a reverse proxy to provide faster page loads and protect us from DDOS attacks. In this capacity, they may store and analyse your IP address.
                         Please refer to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's privacy policy</a> for full details.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>YouTube (Data API)
                    <p>
                        We use the YouTube Data API to access your YouTube account, in order to retrieve and edit your playlists. All actions taken (especially which videos are in each playlist) will be visible to YouTube, and therefore Google.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, your IP address may be recorded in webserver logs. This is to allow us to identify and block any attackers. At no point is this IP address linked to your YouTube account - your YouTube account is not sent to our servers.
